        <title>Bali 2017</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I stayed in Bali for four weeks. Good to mix relaxing with  work!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;accommodation&quot;&gt;Accommodation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;villas&quot;&gt;Villas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both in Seminyak and Sanur we rented a villa. This gives you all the flexibility. Most houses in Bali come with a pool, nice to  to cool off in the heat, start your morning with a little swim or chill in the evening with some music. Check out Airbnb, there are usually many options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;guest-house&quot;&gt;Guest house&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Ubud we also stayed at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.booking.com/hotel/id/bucu-guest-house.en-gb.html&quot;&gt;Bucu Guest House&lt;/a&gt;. They have a wonderful pool and nice rooms and a very reasonable price (usually 30k IPR per night per room with breakfast). As they had some construction going on the dropped the price to 25k IPR. If you are on a budget or on your way around exploring all day anyways: definitely recommended!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hotels&quot;&gt;Hotels&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or course there are many hotels around. While it was quite nice to stay for a week at &lt;a href=&quot;http://greenfieldubud.com/&quot;&gt;Green Field Hotel&lt;/a&gt; with a ricefield view (and their complementary drivers to get around ubud!), I’d prefer Airbnb on the long term!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; defer=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-around&quot;&gt;Getting around&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taxi drivers have a very bad reputation. Sadly for a good cause. On the airport they are waiting in thousands (okay, maybe a hundred) to rip you off for a high price. Our first Airbnb host organized a driver that was waiting for us. This way you make sure you find the place and don’t have to fight with the drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uber and GoJek (Uber-like service) are available and in many times the cheapest option, but not much appreciated in the local community. Uber drivers did always call upfront to confirm the pickup spot. Try not to order an Uber in the main streets and let them pick you up right in front of your hotel or house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest option would be for you to rent a scooter. Two wheel drives are the bulk of the traffic anyways. They are usually cheap to get (50-75k IPR per day). You can ask your host to organize that for you or look for any of the shops on the streets. Cars get stuck in traffic quite often and I cannot imagine driving there by myself with all those scooters around the car. Don’t be afraid. I have neither driven a scooter before nor did i drive on the left side on the street. Worked out fine nevertheless. Practice a little bit on a smaller road with low traffic, avoid the really big streets and high traffic and you should be good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-to-do&quot;&gt;Things to do&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hired a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.driver-ubud.com/&quot;&gt;driver&lt;/a&gt; (about 700k IPR for the whole day) and made a tour around the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Taman Ayun Temple&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jatiluwih rice terasses&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tanah Lot&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pura Tirta Empul Temple&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Taman Ayun Temple&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might also want to check out the Mt. Batur Volcano or the Nusa Penida Island, both with stunning nature to explore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; defer=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Ubud itself you can do some things by foot:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ubud palace: The name suggest more than it is. I was a little bit underwhelmed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Monkey Forest: We didn’t go there by ourselves. It’s basically a forest full of monkey. People recommend to leave most of your belongings at home because the tend to steal stuff from you. Walking by the place it looked very full of tourists most of the time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Yoga: While I am not that much of a yogi, many come to Ubud for Yoga. There are many places to practice and attend courses. Most famous is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theyogabarn.com/&quot;&gt;Yoga Barn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Food: Ubud has many good options. I recommend to check ratings on Google Maps. Some of my favorites where &lt;a href=&quot;http://whoswhosworld.com/index.html&quot;&gt;Who’S Who&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/buddhabowlubud/&quot;&gt;Budda Bowl&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/ClearCafeUbud/&quot;&gt;Clear Cafe&lt;/a&gt;. Also try out some of the “Warung”-Places. Warung means “shop” in general, but most are some kind of cheap restaurants.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Luwak coffee: It is very popular to make a stop on the way to Ubud and try the famous Luwak coffee. The locals call it cat-poo-ccino – for a reason ;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Campuhan Ridge Walk: Little (~2km) hike with some nice views on the nature. Start early or late, in the middle of the day the sun would be brutal. In the end you can refresh yourself at the Karsa Kafe (they even had decent wifi).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seminyak was not really my taste. Too many tourist, very hectic. I guess if you want to party with some Australians or go shopping all day this is a great area. Nonetheless there were some great food options, tough more pricey than Ubud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mofokitchen.com/&quot;&gt;MOFO Kitchen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.growbali.com/&quot;&gt;Grow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cornerhousebali.com/&quot;&gt;Corner House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/gofresh.life/&quot;&gt;Gofresh.life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tip: I did not know that “trash season” is a thing in Bali (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://weather.com/travel/news/trash-season-arrives-bali-beach-photos-20140123&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). If you come in the winter months, be prepared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last few days I spend in Sanur, which is closer to the beach. Those days were mainly to rest. Scooters are a necessity here to get around. Otherwise you will melt in the sun walking around. The beach is worth a visit, food options directly at the beach are more average. Check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://duskbluebali.com/&quot;&gt;Dusk Blue&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://soulinabowlbali.com/&quot;&gt;Soul in a Bowl&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;work-work-work&quot;&gt;Work work work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-version=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BOn6piGjIZU/&quot; style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;&quot;&gt;Ein von Jonas (@devicezero) gepostetes Foto&lt;/a&gt; am &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2016-12-30T01:58:38+00:00&quot;&gt;29. Dez 2016 um 17:58 Uhr&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; defer=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point you might need to get some work done. Too bad internet is often extremely bad on the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ubud for example had many options for cafes with great food and coffee. Almost every place offers free wifi at some point, but when it comes to speed they differ a lot. In most cafes I got a few Mbit down and often &amp;lt;1 Mbit up. While this is fine for some tasks it didn’t work out for video calls / screensharing. As sim cards can be bought everywhere and data is cheap (I paid 100k IRP for 8GB) this is definitely an option. I did a few calls on a tethered connection via my phone. I needed data for using maps or Uber on the go anyways and for the price it’s a no-brainer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of my work I decided to go for one of the coworking spaces: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hubud.org/&quot;&gt;Hubud&lt;/a&gt;. They have different plans depending on your needs and how long you stay there. Working barefoot in a house mostly made out of bamboo was a nice experienced and brings you that feeling of relaxing while still working. Also good coffee, cake and free water to keep you hydrated. They do many events for their members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short notice on electricity: I experienced short power outage a few times, but it came back after a few minutes. Just make sure your devices are charged ;-) In Hubud, even when the lights went out, the internet worked. No big deal.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why small teams kick ass</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes less is more: When you want to move fast forward, go small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-a-small-team&quot;&gt;what is a small team&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case the term “small team” reflects on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The team size: number of team members&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An independent culture: the team is responsible for itself and it’s tasks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consistency: team members stay the same over a certain time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Small team size does not equal small companies, even big companies can organize in small, independent teams to kick ass!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;processes&quot;&gt;processes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When humans work together there is no such thing as “the one truth”. The idea of one process that fit’s all companies might sound worth achieving but in reality it isn’t. SCRUM isn’t for everybody and so aren’t Kanban or Extreme Programming. And that is why those methods sometimes fail and sometimes work just fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working together means you have to find some ways of organizing work. But if every process works doesn’t every team - how can you find the “perfect” process? Well, you doesn’t have to! There doesn’t have to be a finish line on your improvement as a team. For example: Some scenarios demand to prioritize speed, in others you need to focus on quality. Usually those priorities will change during the lifecycle of your product / project. You want to be able to adjust quickly to outside and inside circumstances. For that an open culture to allow failures and dispel fear of trying new things is very important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With fewer team members you can try out new processes. Always identify weaknesses and strengths in your workflow to draw conclusions much faster. You simply get everybody on board in one call, not wait for every 50 people to have them read that memo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bonus-tools-tools-tools&quot;&gt;bonus: tools. tools. tools&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is no “one size fits all” in processes – there can’t be one tool that fits every use case. Small independent teams can be more flexible in choosing the tools every individual needs to deliver good work. If you have ever been in touch with a IT-Department of a traditional company you know that flexibility is usually not their core strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;communication&quot;&gt;communication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As technology is evolving extremely fast these days and so many things are possible. It’s just not easy to get everybody on the same page and to actually talk about the same ideas. Communication is key - whether it’s spoken or written. Even when using the same words, you might not talk about the same ideas. So e.g. you might use mockups, images, descriptions, etc. to standardize requirements. In the end everybody on the team has to build her/his part that needs to fit together. The better your communication the easier this gets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a while you usually know each other and how your colleagues communicate. You better know what they want, when to ask them to specify something or you even know when to ask for their opinion. Make sure your team is diverse and consists of different people and opinions. Combining those views together and create great pieces of technology means you have to have a good culture of communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working in smaller teams makes it much easier to adjust to others behavior and be more sensitive about others to move forward, together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;predictability&quot;&gt;predictability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have learned something in the last years it’s that requirements change - especially when working with clients. The industry tries to embrace constant changes (e.g. agile movement, the devops idea, and more). And this is great! But you still need some kind of commitment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everybody has it’s own pace and mindset on how to tackle work. A good culture reflects that and gives everybody the chance to improve but not overstrain too much. “How much can we get done this week?” is only one part of the topic, but a very obvious one. If you work with other teams that rely on your output or you simply need to document to superiors, this is a very common “KPI”. When it comes to predictability within your team it is also quite interesting to agree on “How small do tasks need to be before we can get to work?”. Some people only need a rough idea, some others might need more details and smaller sub-tasks to be able to go concept from execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you estimate in days, in points or other labels – and especially when you don’t estimate at all: At some point (mostly) you need to know what a team is capable of - which is simply much easier to measure and adjust when you have 4 people than 15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;overhead&quot;&gt;overhead&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a hierarchy or a flat organization doesn’t matter. At a certain point of team size, you have some kind of overhead. Overhead is that kind of activity that you need to keep the organization alive. Of course you want to minimize that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more people there are, the more needs to be organized, the more needs to be strictly structured. Bigger organizations compulsorily need to think more as a collective than to consider the individual human being. That doesn’t mean that such an organization is automatically cruel. But big teams demand more handovers of information, higher need for organizing daily business and e.g. in result more meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small teams make it easier to share knowledge, fewer need for a strict structure (“it just works”) and in result getting more work done!&lt;/p&gt;
