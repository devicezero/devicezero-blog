- switched places from Cape Town (South Africa) to Windhoek (Namibia).
- had promising calls with new clients.
- finished the ‚ÄúMVP‚Äù for my standup bot [stehauf.io](https://www.stehauf.io) which is now in public beta!
- had a 6h remote call (which is a stupid thing to do).
- we pushed out a major update for the [dataroom Workflowmanager](https://wfm.data-room.de/en) together #teamwork.
- did a few remote code reviews (more of those please).
- started a website performance monitoring project (more of those please, too).
- made plans for future travels (next are Kenya and Morocco).
- met black kids who made fun of me because I am white üòÇ
- for the first time was angry/troubled because I ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt there‚Äù for someone (meaning physically there) but still managed to help to my best abilities.
- found out, that there simply might not be bad coffee in Africa (at least I did not found one yet).
