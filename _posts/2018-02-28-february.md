- started working remotely from anywhere on this planet full time! This is **HUGE**. I even gave up my apartment back in Germany and I am now full time vagabond ;)
- stayed connected with good friends, this will be always be super important to me whilst I am traveling.
- updated an project from [hapijs](https://hapijs.com/) v16 to v17, promisify all the things!
- already finished filing taxes for 2017.
- wrote _a bunch_ of api route tests during that upgrade, never deploy anything without tests.
- started a new project with Node.js/CouchDB/Vue.js/Docker: [www.stehauf.io](https://www.stehauf.io). Let's see where this goes (currently in closed beta, if you need a simple Slack standup but… just drop me a note ;)).
- set up a production deployment that goes from git push to production in less than five minutes. always deliver!
- hiked up to Lions Head in Cape Town and watched a beautiful sunset.
- went to visit the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa. African art seems to be highly influenced by the topics violence and suffering :(
- got my yellow fever shot for future travels.
- upgraded to an iPhone X from my old 6. much photos, such quality!
- bought all-wooden sunglasses from Bello in Cape Town, because the plastic ones keep on breaking
- visited the Automattic office in Cape Town a few times. Thanks for having me!
