- traveled from Nairobi, Kenya to Casablanca, Morroco

![map of my travels in Morroco](/assets/media/map_morroco.jpg "A map of my travels in Morroco")

- traveled 2.500km around Morroco (Casablanca > Marrakesch > Essaouira > Marrakesch > Quarzatate > Merzouga > Errachidia > Mekenes > Fes > Chefchaouen > Fes > Nador)
  - stayed one night in the sahara desert, and it did rain for a few hours
  - stranded in a random city and had to stay a night to get the bus the next day (with public transport in Morroco you need to bring time)
  - had a lot of moroccan whiskey (mint tea)
  - worked the whole month via LTE because bad WiFi

- wrote a concept for an REST API for a new project
- had clients gone wildly crazy because of the new data protection rules in the EU (GDPR)
- optimised [my website](https://devicezero.de/) and the [stehauf.io](https://stehauf.io) app frontend to deliver the best performance possible #perfmatters
- removed all external dependencies of my website and switched from Bootstrap and jQuery to css grids and vannilla JS.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Reminder that you don’t always need Bootstrap and jQuery (or the other 17 dependencies that you might have) for your site. I just removed most external scripts/css and switched to css grid and vanilla JS. E.g. Speed Index fell from ~1000 to &lt;400 (yes, a simple site, but still).</p>&mdash; Jonas Kröger (@jonaskroeger) <a href="https://twitter.com/jonaskroeger/status/1001436447331749888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 29, 2018</a></blockquote>

- refactored the CI building process of stehauf.io to enable faster deployments
- updated more projects to fix security issues via `npm audit` (still love that feature)
- delivered a bigger update for the [Workflowmanager](https://wfm.data-room.de/en). We now have @-mentions like the cool web apps today do ;) We try to deliver new features every month or so (in addition to minor fixes, security updates, etc.), which is only possible with a great team and fast deployments, automated testing and more. [Drop me an email](mailto:jk@devicezero.de) if you are interested to speed up your development process.
